Zip file is also avaiable for you to download.

It's a full-fledged management system for FYPs. A local user can utilize a filtered method to search for FYP initiatives. There are three panels in this application: an admin panel, a supervisor panel, and a student panel. This website allows students from many universities to register. Users, as well as projects from both supervisors and students, can be viewed and approved by the admin. Although a supervisor can add projects that are only approved by the administrator, student projects can be approved by both the administrator and the supervisor. The user profile must be approved by an administrator, either as a student or as a supervisor, before the user can log in. FYP projects can be added by students or supervisors who provide thorough information about them.
